# statistics
This repository is for containing sources codes of statistical concepts like outlier detection, etc.

**population:** It is a large volume of observations.

**sample:**  It is a small portion of that population. Using these sample statistics, we make conclusions about the population.

**mean:** It is the average of a collection of values. We can calculate the mean by dividing the sum of all observations by the number of observations.

**variance:** It is a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. More specifically, variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean (average), and thus from every other number in the set. Variance is often depicted by this symbol: Ïƒ2.
