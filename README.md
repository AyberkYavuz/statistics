# statistics
This repository is for containing sources codes of statistical concepts like outlier detection, etc.

**population:** It is a large volume of observations.

**sample:**  It is a small portion of that population. Using these sample statistics, we make conclusions about the population.

**mean:** It is the average of a collection of values. We can calculate the mean by dividing the sum of all observations by the number of observations.

**variance:** It is a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. More specifically, variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean (average), and thus from every other number in the set. Variance is often depicted by this symbol: Ïƒ2.

**standard deviation:** It is simply the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is useful when comparing the spread of two separate data sets that have approximately the same mean. The data set with the smaller standard deviation has a narrower spread of measurements around the mean and therefore usually has comparatively fewer high or low values. An item selected at random from a data set whose standard deviation is low has a better chance of being close to the mean than an item from a data set whose standard deviation is higher. However, standard deviation is affected by extreme values. A single extreme value can have a big impact on the standard deviation.
